The **AI News Delivery Agent** is an intelligent, fully automated system designed to streamline the way users consume news. By integrating RSS feeds, user-defined interests, and advanced language models, it fetches, filters, ranks, and summarizes the most relevant news stories each day. The agent eliminates the need for manual browsing or app-based curation by delivering a concise, personalized digest—typically via email—tailored to the user’s specific topics of interest. This ensures users stay informed without being overwhelmed, making the news experience faster, more focused, and highly efficient.
